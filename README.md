# Time Tracker (formerly Elapsed Time Calculator)

v.2 introduce a lot of new features, see [changelog here](https://github.com/fbgallet/roam-extension-elapsed-time/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

Easily **track the time spent on your activities and calculate the total time spent on them**, organized by categories and sub-categories (and so on), and see if predefined **limits or goals** are respected. Helps to implement **interstitial journaling**.
Review total by day, week, month, quarter, year, or any given period of time.

‚ö†Ô∏è This extension works more easily in combination with `TimeStamp Buttons and elapsed time calculator` **SmartBlocks**. Once 'Smartblocks extension' from RoamDepot is installed, install 'TimeStamp Buttons and elapsed time calculator' from the SmartBlocks Store (open command palette with Ctrl-Cmd + P, then search for "SmartBlocks Store").

## Features and instructions

All commands in command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + p) begin with "Time tracker: " and you can set custom hotkeys for each of them.

### Elapsed time
Calculate and insert elapsed time between two timestamp. The `Elapsed time` command has different behaviors depending on the context:
  - if the current block contains a timestamp, a second timestamp (now) will be added and the elapsped time calculated,
  - if it contains already two timestamps, the elapsed time will be (re)calculated,
  - if there is no timestamp (or a Smartblock button for a timestamp), a timestamp (now) will be inserted,

üí° If you set hotkeys for this command, **it will very easy, with the same hotkeys**, to insert a first timestamp, then insert the second and get the elapsed time.

Another way to insert easily timestamps and run this command is to use SmartBlocks command. For instructions, see 'SmartBlocks commands' section below.

### Total time
Calculate:
  - `total in the entire page, by categories`:
  - `total for current week` or month, quarter, year: 
  - `total according to natural language expression in current block`:
  - `simple total in context (sibbling/children blocks)`:
  - `total for current page and all its references`:

For any of these commands, 
  - if the cursor is in a block without children, total and total by categories will be inserted here
  - if the cursor is in a block with children, total and total by categories will be inserted as the last children, and a block reference to the total will be inserted in the current block
  - if no block is selected, the total will be inserted as the last block of the page


- **Categories and sub-categories**: you can define a list of categories, used as trigger words for elapsed time calculation of an interval and for more details in the total calculation. Just write them in plain text **or mention them as block reference** (so you can easily find the right category with block search) in a block where you want to measure the elapsed time on the correspoding task.
  - Each category can be subdivided in sub-categories (e.g. 'reading', subdivided in 'article' and 'book'). If a sub-categorie is mentionned in the current block, the time will also be added to the parent categorie in total calculation, and sub-categories can be dispayed or not in the total calculation.
  - (Advanced use of categories) You can mention multiple categories in the same block, time will be added in all of them. A category can also be duplicated as a sub-category of another category and be used as a more general 'tag' for timetracking. E.g., if 'deep work' is defined as a category, it can also be a subcategory of 'reading'. If, in a block, you mention 'deep work' alone, the corresponding time will be added only to the 'deep work' category. But if you mention 'deep work reading', it will be added both to 'deep work' category and 'deep work' sub-category of 'reading' (and to 'reading').

- **Goals and limits**: for each category or sub-category, you can define a goal (minimum to reach) or a limit (maximum not to exceed). Depending on whether the limit is respected or not, a flag (by default, a set of icon but you can switch to color tags or customize your own flags) will be inserted in the block, after elapsed time or total time spent. By default, a popup window will ask for confirmation before inserting the flag for the current task. It will be automatically applied in the total time blocks. Goals or limits can be defined both for an interval (elapsed time between two timestamps for a given task) or for the day (list of intervals in the current page). You can set a goal or a limit inline, only for the current block, with `min:` and `max:` keyword, followed by a number of minutes. Native pomodoro timer is also taken into account as a limit (maximum) time.

## Configuration

- **Set your categories**: create anywhere in your graph a list of categories and, if needed, of sub-categories as children blocks of any given category. Copy the block reference of the direct parent block of this list in the corresponding field in the settings panel. Or run `Goals & limits setting template for Elapsed Time extension`, fill the template and click on the button to update extension settings.

- **Set goals and limits**: create anywhere in your graph a list with the following structure, and copy (or Ctrl/Cmd + Drag&Drop) block references of categories/sub-categories under the desired durations. Then, copy the block reference of the direct parent block of this list in the corresponding field in the settings panel. Or run `Categories & subcategories setting template for Elapsed Time extension` SmartBlock, which will generate a template that you can complete, and where you will drag&drop the needed block references.

  ```
  - Parent block [copy its block reference in settings panel]
    - Goals
      - interval
        -10'
          - ((block reference of a category or subcategory))
          - ...
        - 20'
          - ((...))
      - day
        - 60'
          - ((...))
    - Limits
      [same kind of structure as for Goals]
      - interval
        - ...
      - day
        - ...
  ```

- Follow the instructions for other user settings directly in the settings panel above.

- **Use the extension in your workflow with Smartblocks**: You have to install `TimeStamp Buttons and elapsed time calculator` Smartblocks. Then:

  - Run `Day log - Elapsed time` in your daily template or **Copy/Paste** the following buttons (or keep the templates you used with the previous version, which remains compatible)

    - `{{üïó‚Ü¶:SmartBlock:Double timestamp buttons}}`: **in your daily template** for creating the **first timestamp**, which will allow to generate an indefinite number of intervals with a simple click.

    - `{{Total üïó:SmartBlock:Total time spent}}`: where you want to calculate the **total time** spent during the day, **either in a sibling block** to the blocks containing the elapsed times, **or in their parent block**. You can also run `Total time button` to create this button in the right place.

  - You can copy and adapt the existing SmartBlocks to your needs (with a new name, otherwise they will be overwritten in case of update) or use `<%ELAPSEDTIME%>` and `<%TOTALTIME%>` commands in your own SmartBlocks.
