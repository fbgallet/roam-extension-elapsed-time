v.2 (may 20th, 2023) Major update
### New features:
  - **Total by period** ! Week, month, quarter, year or any given period
  - Total is now calculated on all levels, not only sibbling blocks
  - Total for a given page and all its references
  - `Set categories and Goals & limits` simplify configuration
  - Categories and Goals & limits changes are auto-updated
  - Table view of total, also copied to clipboard for easy export

## Updates:
  - `Elapsed time` command is way more versatile and replace existing buttons by timestamp
  - Categories admit any number of sub-categories levels
  - A page reference `[[category]]` is applied to all children elapsed times (unless a distinct, not sub-category of the former, is mentioned)
  - Pomodoros are taken into account in total
And a lot of fixes and large refactoring of the code
